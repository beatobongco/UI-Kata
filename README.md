# UI Kata

Tiny UI experiments of mine inspired by life and work.

I take something that interests me (a website, UI component, real life thing) as a "prompt" to create stuff or remix it to learn something new.

## Format

 * Date - when the kata was performed
 * Title - creative title for the kata
 * Prompt - link to the prompt
 * Kata - the actual content of the kata
