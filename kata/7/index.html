		<h2>What is reddaily?</h2>

		<p>reddaily is a client-side reddit aggregator. It's designed to give you your daily dose of reddit with less of the distraction.</p>

		<p>Give it a try here: <a href="https://beatobongco.com/reddaily/">https://beatobongco.com/reddaily/</a></p>

		<p>Of course, as I <span style="color: tomato">&hearts;</span> responsive design, it looks good on mobile.</p>

		<h2>Why?</h2>

		<p>I browse reddit often.</p>

		<p>Sometimes it contains interesting, mind-expanding articles and discussions relevant to my field. Oftentimes, it does not and results in an entertaining but ultimately time-wasting undertaking.</p>

		<p>I decided one day that I would like the positive things reddit gives me without having to waste time on the negatives so I observed my own behavior for a while.</p>

		<p>I noticed these things:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>I don't normally post or comment on reddit.</li>
			<li>I usually visit only certain subreddits.</li>
			<li>I sort almost every subreddit by "top".</li>
			<li>The posts that usually had a positive impact on my life were those with many upvotes.</li>
			<li>I sometimes get sidetracked by content that's entertaining but not entirely of good quality.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>I knew right off the bat that making an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggregator">aggregator</a> was the answer. I'm a big fan of <a href="http://www.daemonology.net/hn-daily/">Colin Percival's Hacker News Daily</a>. I wanted something like that.</p>

		<p>I also wanted it to be completely client-side because that's my shtick (and so I don't have to pay to run a server).</p>

		<h2>Making reddaily</h2>

		<p>Reddaily is extremely simple. You can take a look at it <a href="https://github.com/beatobongco/reddaily">here</a>. It just uses reddit's public JSON API which can be accessed by basically adding <i>.json</i> to any reddit URL.</p>

		<p>e.g. <code>https://www.reddit.com/r/climbing -> https://www.reddit.com/r/climbing.json</code></p>

		<p>Then I just use <a href="https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent">superagent</a> to pull the data and <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue">Vue</a> to display. The list of subreddits can be set in a <a href="https://github.com/beatobongco/reddaily/blob/master/settings.js">settings file</a>.</p>

		<h2>Results of usage</h2>

		<p>When I made this on October of last year, I was using it daily as designed on both my laptop and phone. Prior to reddaily I was browsing reddit for around 2 hours a day. </p>

		<p>Reddaily weaned me off browsing the actual website by scratching the itch of knowing what's new but reducing potential distraction by acting as a middleman/curator who hides and sorts posts for me and only gives me more links when I specifically request for them. </p>

		<p>The design also helped as I made the link to the comments section non-prominent by reducing it's font size and choosing a font color that wasn't very good for readability. It's still there when I need it but it doesn't call out to be clicked.</p>

		<p>What eventually happened was that I quit reddit almost completely. Most days I just take a quick glance at reddaily and if nothing piques my interest, I never end up on reddit at all. Mission accomplished. Not bad for a day's work! :)</p>
